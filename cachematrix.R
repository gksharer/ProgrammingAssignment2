## This cachematrix.R function caches the inverse of a matrix. 
## It consists of two functions : makeCacheMatrix, cacheSolve

## makeCacheMatrix creates a matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve retrieves the cached inverse of makeCacheMatrix,
## if the cache does not exist or the matrix has changed then it computes the inverse 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
